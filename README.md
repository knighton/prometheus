## Prometheus

This repository serves as a notebook for miscellaneuos configuration steps performed on the Prometheus machine.

Prometheus is the black box located in Veng. Its primary feature is the 12GB onboard RAM nVidia Titan-X graphics card (as well as a motherboard that supports up to four such graphics cards). Its other specs include a 6-core 2.4GHz Xeon CPU and 32GB of RAM. If you would like to build your own machine similar to this one, this whitepaper from nVidia might be helpful: https://developer.nvidia.com/devbox (download requires registration).

The name "Prometheus" was inspired by the Titan from Greek mythology who acquired a new technology (fyre) for use by mankind.
